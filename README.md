# Py-RAMID
A **Py**thon package of a **R**iverware and **A**gent-based **M**odeling **I**nterface for **D**evelopers.

We developed a Python package of Riverware (RW, a river-reservoir routing model) and Agent-based Modeling (ABM, a human model) Interface for Developers, Py-RAMID, to address co-evolution challenges in a coupled natural-human system. Py-RAMID is designed to work under Python 3.7 and Windows environments. 

The documentation can be found [here](https://py-ramid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?).

If you use Py-RAMID, we would appreciate it if you cite the following paper.
